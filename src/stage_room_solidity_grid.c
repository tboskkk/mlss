/* No C attempt yet. Deliberately EMPTY rather than an #error: agbcc
   compiles a whole translation unit at a time, so an #error here fails
   every OTHER function in this file under NONMATCHING=1. Guard intact, so
   the real ROM still gets the verbatim retail bytes and progress.py still
   counts this as unmatched. Write the C here, replacing this comment.

   The previous draft here was TRUNCATED mid-expression -- an unbalanced
   brace, which swallows the rest of the translation unit and makes agbcc
   report the failure at 'end of input' or against some innocent later
   function. That mis-attribution is why unblock_files.py could never
   clear it: it blames the guard block containing the reported line. */
